# ü§ñ Welcome to Jarvis
This is the official repository where all the code of Jarvis is stored. 

## Bot Description
### Description
This bot is mainly a personal project. It's developed for fun and personal use. 

## Technical Notions
### Language used
This bot uses mainly **JavaScript** for many reasons. The most important one is that Discord is built with JavaScript (among others languages), so it's more easy and efficient to write the entire project. It's easier to implement this language and its frameworks in many ways, for example if we want to build a full website to store this bot.

### Technical issues
Since the beginning of the project (were @PaascuZ was the solo developer) there were many difficulties implementing many things, like the music function. But here we are, fixing them and taking this project on a serious way. Inside this snippet will be written all the current issues.
